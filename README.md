# Dynamic MFA of Aluminium use in passenger cars
This repository contains the code (python) and data (csv files in the data folder) used for the paper <b>Aluminium use in passenger cars poses systemic challenges for recycling and GHG emissions</b> that was submitted to <i>Resources Conservation & Recycling</i>.

This dynamic Material Flow Analysis model is used to quantify future scenarios for the global automotive aluminium cycle up to 2050. It allows the user to quantify how current trends (transition to Electric Vehicles, preference for larger cars such as SUVs, increasing population and car ownership) influence the demand for aluminium in passenger cars, as well as the consequences this has for recycling and the carbon footprint of aluminium in cars. The model and data structure is based on the ODYM model:https://github.com/IndEcol/ODYM

<b>An interactive visualisation of the results of the model is also available at the following URL: http://129.241.153.168:8050/</b><br>
It allows the user to visualize the 8748 scenarios developed in the model through an interactive Sankey diagram of the automotive aluminium cycle and additional graphs to quantify the impact of the different scenario parameters on the aluminium demand, scrap surplus, and GHG emissions.

The version of the model that was used for the paper that was submitted to Resources Conservation & Recycling, as well as additional result files, is available on Zenodo: https://www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7041497
